abstract = {This paper proceeds by discussing some general aspects of how extrinsic incentives may come into confl ict with other motivations. For example, monetar incentives from principals may change how tasks are perceived by agents. If incen- tives are not large enough, this change in perception can lead to undesired effects on behavior. In other cases, incentives might have the desired effects in the short term, but they still weaken intrinsic motivations. Thus, once the incentives are removed, people may pursue the desired outcome less eagerly. To put it in concrete terms, an incentive for a child to read more might achieve that goal in the short term, but then be counterproductive as an incentive for students to enjoy reading and seek it out over their lifetimes. The following sections of the paper then discuss and seek it out over their lifetimes. The following sections of the paper then discuss the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: educa- have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: educa- tion; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their tion; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their lifestyles. The conclusion sums up some lessons on when extrinsic incentives are lifestyles.

abstract = {The literature on online communities has investigated motivations of contributors, but the effects of rewards on motivations and performance have hardly been addressed. In this study, we develop theory on the effects of reward size on motivation and performance of contributors. Performance refers to quantity, usefulness and novelty of contributions. By building on recent psychology literature, we distinguish between contextual and situational motivations. In this way, this paper contributes to both online communities and psychology literatures.},

abstract = {A simple principal agent problem is experimentally investigated in which a principal repeatedly sets a wage and an agent responds by choosing an effort level. The principal's payoff is determined by the agent's effort. In a first setting the principal can only set a fixed wage in each period. In a second setting the principal has the possibility to supplement the fixed wage with a piece rate. Surprisingly, efforts are lower in the case where piece rates can be paid. Furthermore, switching in the same treatment from a setting where piece rates are available to one where only fixed wages can be paid tends to lead to even lower effort levels. Based on our findings we suggest a new explanation for motivation crowding out by arguing that the use of piece rates considerably alters the principals' and agents' perception of the situation.},

abstract = {Workers in a wide variety of jobs are paid based on performance, which is commonly seen as en- hancing effort and productivity relative to non-contingent pay schemes. However, psychological research suggests that excessive rewards can, in some cases, result in a decline in performance. To test whether very high monetary rewards can decrease performance, we conducted a set of experiments in the U.S. and in India in which subjects worked on different tasks and received performance-contingent payments that varied in amount from small to very large relative to their typical levels of pay.With some important exceptions, very high reward levels had a detrimental effect on performance.},
