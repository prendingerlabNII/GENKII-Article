abstract = {This paper proceeds by discussing some general aspects of how extrinsic incentives may come into confl ict with other motivations. For example, monetar incentives from principals may change how tasks are perceived by agents. If incen- tives are not large enough, this change in perception can lead to undesired effects on behavior. In other cases, incentives might have the desired effects in the short term, but they still weaken intrinsic motivations. Thus, once the incentives are removed, people may pursue the desired outcome less eagerly. To put it in concrete terms, an incentive for a child to read more might achieve that goal in the short term, but then be counterproductive as an incentive for students to enjoy reading and seek it out over their lifetimes. The following sections of the paper then discuss and seek it out over their lifetimes. The following sections of the paper then discuss the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: educa- have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: educa- tion; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their tion; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their lifestyles. The conclusion sums up some lessons on when extrinsic incentives are lifestyles. The conclusion sums up some lessons on when extrinsic incentives are more or less likely to alter such behaviors in the desired directions. more or less likely to alter such behaviors in the desired directions.},

abstract = {The literature on online communities has investigated motivations of contributors, but the effects of rewards on motivations and performance have hardly been addressed. In this study, we develop theory on the effects of reward size on motivation and performance of contributors. Performance refers to quantity, usefulness and novelty of contributions. By building on recent psychology literature, we distinguish between contextual and situational motivations. In this way, this paper contributes to both online communities and psychology literatures.},
